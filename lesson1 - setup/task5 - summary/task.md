# Summary

Congratulations.

You have:

- installed Sensei
- installed a 3rd party Cookbook from GitHub
- used a Recipe in the Cookbook to fix a coding issue:
   - from the Hover Context popup
   - from the Intentions popup
    
  
Sensei allows you to create your own recipes that match coding patterns and create custom QuickFix code replacements to amend the code and enforce your own coding standards.

In the next lesson we will look at, and amend the recipe we used, to see how Sensei implements the recipes.

But first... a quick Quiz. Choose an answer from the list below and click `[Check]` button to complete this task.

## What does Sensei help you do?
