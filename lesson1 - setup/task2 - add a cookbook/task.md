# Add A Cookbook

Sensei uses Cookbooks of Recipes which are designed to help you with a particular technology or for your Team coding standards.

To help with this tutorial, we have created a Cookbook on GitHub that you can add to this project. In this less on we will install it, and we'll use it in the next task.

To install the Cookbook.

Open the Sensei Cookbooks manager, either by:

- clicking on the "Sensei Cookbooks" tab
- choose "Recipe Editor" from the main "Sensei" menu

Now we want to add a reference to the Cookbook on GitHub.

- Click the "+" button to add a new cookbook.
- Give it a name e.g. "Sensei Edutools"
- For the location, use the URL our recipe repo:
    - `https://insert repo here`
  
In the short term, just add:

- https://github.com/SecureCodeWarrior/cookbook-basic-protection-set.git

_We need to see if edu tools is solid enough to work with._
But since you know what you are doing... create a recipe in a project://.sensei cookbook to change and complete Task 3. Close the IDE down and see if the recipe persists in a local cookbook.

---
    
Once you've installed it, Sensei will start analysing your code in real-time to find any Recipes that match.

If you've done this correctly then you'll see the cookbook in the "Locally configured cookbooks" list, and when you start the next task you see some code that has been highlighted by Sensei as being in error.
