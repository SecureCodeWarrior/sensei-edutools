## Install Sensei

We need to install the Sensei plugin before we can do anything.

The easiest way to install it is in the IDE itself:



- From "Preferences\Settings | Plugins":
  - On a Mac: use "IntelliJ IDEA | Preferences | Plugins"
  - On Windows: use |Settings | Plugins"
- Choose "Marketplace"
- search for "Sensei secure code warrior"
- Install

Note: 
If you need more help installing plugins then there are [instructions on the JetBrains site](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html). 

You'll need to restart the editor, and when you do. We'll see you back here in a few seconds to start on the next task.

You'll know when Sensei is in stalled because you'll see the Sensei menu in the menu bar.

And you'll see the "Sensei Cookbooks" tab in the bottom.
