## Install Sensei

We need to install the Sensei plugin before we can do anything.

The easiest way to install it is from within **%IDE_NAME%** itself:

- From **Preferences\Settings | Plugins**:
  - On macOS: use **IntelliJ IDEA | Preferences | Plugins**
  - On Windows: use **Settings | Plugins**
- Choose **Marketplace**
- search for "**Sensei secure code warrior**"
- Click the `[Install]` button

If you need more help installing plugins then there are <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html">instructions on the JetBrains site</a>. 
</div>

You'll need to restart **%IDE_NAME%**, and when you do. We'll see you back here in a few seconds to start on the next task.

> Click `[Check]` when you are ready to move on to the next task.

You'll know when Sensei is installed because you'll see the Sensei menu in the menu bar.

And you'll see the "Sensei Cookbooks" tab in the bottom.
